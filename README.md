# A/V Accessibility App <br><br>

This simple app is meant to exist so anybody<br>
can access any type of media and enjoy it.<br>
Features include subtitles for each type of media,<br>
including music(lyrics), available in both French and English<br>
as many Canadians are bilingual. Also a visual synthesizer is<br>
available for the music so someone has a visual stimulator as<br>
they are reading the lyrics to get a better sense of the music.<br>
Lastly, the web transcripts for the subtitles are available to be read.<br>
