00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.000
(music) It's not every day that a zookeeper

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
went to prison for murder for hire.

3
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:09.000
There are more captive tigers in the US

4
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:12.000
Then there are in the wild throughout the world.

5
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.000
Animal people are nuts, man.

6
00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.000
They're all crazy.

7
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:22.000
I'm sure y'all got a story to tell.

8
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:24.000
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

9
00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:26.000
My name's Joe Exotic. This is Sarge.

10
00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:27.000
He was like a mythical character,

11
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:30.000
living out in the middle of Bumfuck, Oklahoma.

12
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.000
who owned 1,200 tigers and lions

13
00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.000
and bears and shit.

14
00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.000
Tell me you love me.

15
00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:38.000
I'm outspoken, good looking, love to party and have fun.

16
00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.000
I don't think we're done blowing shit up today.

17
00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:44.000
I don't figure you are.

18
00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.000
They have a heart and a soul and a mind.

19
00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:48.000
I've learned from them.

20
00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.000
But Carole Baskin keeps saying

21
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.000
I can't have these tigers.

22
00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:52.000
If he ever had an enemy in his life,

23
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.000
it was Carole Baskin.

24
00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.000
Hey, cool cats and kittens, it's Carole at Big Cat Rescue.

25
00:00:57.000 --> 00:00:59.000
Carole was the Mother Teresa of cats.

26
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:01.000
We will end the private posession of these cats.

27
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:04.000
This is my way of living.

28
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:07.000
and nobody's gonna tell me otherwise.

29
00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.000
Carole has an army of people working for free.

30
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.000
She's a plain out hypocrite.

31
00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.000
She literally does everything I do.

32
00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:17.000
So Joe said, "Will you go to Florida, and..." what?

33
00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:18.000
"Kill that fucking lady".

34
00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:20.000
What a story.

35
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:22.000
and it got way bigger!

36
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:24.000
Sometimes they say I'm a prototype for Scarface.

37
00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.000
We're supposed to be sexy 'cause we're luring people in.

38
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:36.000
You may now kiss the grooms.

39
00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.000
You're gonna have to kill me to shut me up.

40
00:01:41.200 --> 00:01:43.000
This is my first album, I Saw a Tiger.

41
00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:46.000
There's 28 songs and 16 music videos.

42
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.000
I saw a tiger

43
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.000
Now I understand

44
00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:56.000
I saw a tiger

45
00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:00.000
And the tiger saw a man

46
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:16.000
(silence)
